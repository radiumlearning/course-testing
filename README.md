This repository holds the examples that will be used in all 3 RN Testing Lectures as well as the practice exercises that will be presented at the end of each lecture as asynchronous material.

### Lecture #1: Testing with Jest

- Summary of the 3 lectures
- Brief explanation of what [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) is and what is used for
- How to approach a test
- Live practical testing examples on utils used in a real project
- How to view and interpret coverage
- Sharing & explaining asynchronous material

### Lecture #2: Testing Redux

- Q&A: Lecture #1 asynchronous material
- Introduction to [MSW](https://mswjs.io/) and asynchronous actions testing
- Brief explanation of the utils (getMockStore and getMockState) we use and what problems they solve
- Live practical examples of a reducer test
- Live practical examples of an action test
- Brief explanation of how to mock an API call with MSW
- Live practical examples of an asynchronous action test with a mocked API
- Sharing & explaining asynchronous material

### Lecture #3: Testing React Native Components

- Q&A: Lecture #2 asynchronous material
- Introduction to [RTL](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-native-testing-library/intro)
- Live practical examples of a simple component test
- Live practical examples of a component test with Redux
- Sharing & explaining asynchronous material

### Where to find the material

- First, checkout to the corresponding branch for the class you are taking


Class 1 (clase-1/exercises)
- Navigate to `packages/lib/utils/exercises`


Class 2 (clase-2/exercises)
- Navigate to `packages/mobile/src/redux/modules/users/userReducers.test.ts`
- Go to the end of the file & you should see an incomplete test for you to finish
- Navigate to `packages/mobile/src/redux/modules/users/actions/exercises`
- In that folder there should be two actions that are missing tests, go ahead and write them!


Class 3 (clase-3/exercises)
- TBD


## Workflow

Participants will have to fork this repo in order to publish their own asynchronous material solutions in the form of a PR, each class will have their own separate branches each already created. This is meant to be a way to keep track of each student's work and keep the repo tidy and reusable for future lectures.
